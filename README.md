Used a map to show the locations of Citi Bike stations. Color-code the stations based on metrics like usage frequency or bike availability.

Created line charts or area charts to visualize the usage patterns over time that includes daily, weekly, or monthly trends.

Include visualizations that represent subscribers vs. customers.

Created visualizations that showcase popular bike routes or travel patterns. 

Integrate key performance indicators (KPIs) that summarize the overall system performance. This might include metrics like total rides, average ride duration, or system efficiency.

Explore the possibility of incorporating predictive analytics, such as forecasting future bike usage based on historical data.

We created interactive dashboards is interactive, allowing users to filter and explore the data dynamically.

Use Tableau's storytelling features to guide users through a narrative.
